                <p class="secsubtag">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge,
                    skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods include
                    teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place
                    under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take
                    place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one
                    thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called
                    pedagogy. Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or
                    kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In
                    most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.There are movements for education reforms,
                    such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and
                    efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education
                    methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United
                    Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes
                    quality education for all. </p>

                <p class="secsubtag"> Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and
                    skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and
                    through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the
                    next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                    through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                    Kingdom. Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements
                    published in 1607Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in
                    Europe.The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as
                    the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the
                    3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following
                    the fall of Rome in CE 476.In China, Confucius (551-479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's
                    most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies
                    of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in
                    vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down
                    by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era. </p>

                <p class="secsubtag">The education sector or education system is a group of institutions (ministries of
                    education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities,
                    etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational
                    settings. It involves a wide range of people (curriculum developers, inspectors, school principals,
                    teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to different
                    contexts. Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through
                    various elements such as education policies and guidelines - to which school policies can refer -
                    curricula and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The
                    school environment - both physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) - is also
                    guided by school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school.The
                    Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has found that schools tend to perform best
                    when principals have full authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in
                    core subjects upon graduation. They must also seek feedback from students for quality-assurance and
                    improvement. Governments should limit themselves to monitoring student proficiency. </p>
